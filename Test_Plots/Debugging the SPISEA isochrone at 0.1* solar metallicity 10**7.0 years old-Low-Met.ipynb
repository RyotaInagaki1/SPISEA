    "## Testing and Debugging the BPASS isochrone at 10^7.0 years age. (Non Solar Metallicity)\n",
    "In this BPASS isochrone and cluster plot, I go over the BPASS isochrone for 10^7.0 years age, a tenth of solar metallicity, AKs=0.0, and distance of 1000 parsecs from Earth. From the isochrone and cluster, we discuss several plots such as the log_g frequency distribution of the isochrone, the color magnitude diagram (B-V vs M_V), and the current-mass luminosity relationship of the cluster."

    "For a sanity check, we can see that the primaries, secondaries, and single stars have phasees of 5 or of 101 or of 110 (state of NEWSECMODS remnant primaries). This is since we haven't added neutron stars or black holes yet. Stars with phase of -99 exist, and those are the secondary stars that have already merged."
